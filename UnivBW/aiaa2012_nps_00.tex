\section{Feasible Path Generation}
This section introduces an approach that supports mission planning and task
execution steps by a fleet of multiple cooperative UAVs. As soon as the
mission objectives are defined by the high level cognitive components, the
set of specific tasks targeting an application of each of the UAVs in the
fleet, needs to be designed. The task of each UAV in a cooperative mission
should specify the trajectory (both the path and the velocity profile) such
that the mission objectives are achieved, each of the UAVs and their
payloads do not exceed the flight dynamics or operational constraints, and
that the deconfliction and collision avoidance conditions are met.
% In case
%when the mission objectives are modified during the task execution, the
%method developed also allows for near real-time trajectories regeneration to
%account for changes in operational environment.
Thus, this section outlines a path generation approach that is suitable for
near real-time computation of feasible trajectories for multiple UAVs that
are de-conflicted in space and that can be followed by resorting to the
cooperative path following algorithm briefly described later in the paper.

Consider a fleet of $n$ UAVs that are tasked to start from different
locations (initial conditions) and arrive at the mission required final
conditions. The exact time of arrival is not specified, but it may be
restricted to lie within certain bounds.Suppose the objective of the task
for each UAV is to execute this multi-vehicle mission while avoiding
inter-vehicle collisions, meeting dynamical constraints (e.g. bounds on
maximum accelerations), and minimizing a weighted combination of vehicle
energy expenditures.

At first inspection, a possible solution to this problem would be to solve a
constrained optimization problem that would yield (if at all possible)
feasible trajectories $p_{c_i}(t), t \in [0, t_f]; i=1,2,...,n$ for the
vehicles, where $t_f$ denotes the final time. Trajectory tracking systems
on-board the UAVs would then ensure precise tracking of the trajectories
generated, thus meeting the mission objectives.

This seemingly straightforward solution suffers from a major drawback: it
does not allow for any ``deviations from the plan''. Absolute timing becomes
crucial because the strategy described does not lend itself to on-line
modification in the event that one or more of the vehicles cannot execute
trajectory tracking accurately (e.g. due to adverse winds or lack of
sufficient propulsion power). For this reason, it is far more practical to
adopt a different solution where absolute time is not crucial and enough
room is given to each vehicle to adjust its motion along the path in
response to the motions of the other vehicles.
%The goal is that of reaching
%a terminal formation pattern that will ensure simultaneous arrival times.

Dispensing with absolute time is key to the solution proposed. In this
set-up, the optimization process should be viewed as a method to produce
paths $p_{c_i}(\tau_i)$ without explicit time constraints, but with timing
laws for $\tau_i(t)$ that effectively dictate how the nominal speed of each
vehicle should evolve along the path. Using this set-up, spatial and
temporal constraints are decoupled and captured in the descriptions of
$p_{c_i}(\tau_i)$ and $\eta_i(\tau_i)=d\tau_i/dt$, respectively, as will be
seen later. Furthermore, adopting polynomial approximations for
$p_{c_i}(\tau_i)$ and $\eta_i(\tau_i)=d\tau_i/dt$ keeps the number of
optimization parameters reduced and makes near real-time computational
requirements easy to achieve. Intuitively, by making the path of a generic
vehicle a polynomial function of  $\tau \in \ [0, \tau_f ]$, the shape of
the path in space can be changed by increasing or decreasing $\tau$ - a
single optimization parameter. This, coupled with a polynomial approximation
for $\eta(\tau)=d\tau/dt$, makes it easy to shape the speed and acceleration
profile of the vehicle along the path so as to meet desired dynamical
constraints. The paths thus generated are the ``templates'' used for path
following, as explained later in the paper.

%In particular, In addition, the vehicle's velocity and acceleration
%can be easily computed along this path. If the path length is too
%short, vehicle's velocity and acceleration will exceed the
%pre-specified bounds thus making the trajectories infeasible -
%impossible for vehicle to track given its dynamic constraints. This
%simple idea allows for computing feasible trajectories in real-time
%using a small number of optimization parameters.


The above circle of ideas was first explored in Refs. \cite{Neljubov,
Taranenko, Taranenko-Momdgi, Yakimenko} for a single aircraft. This paper
extends these results to the case of multiple UAVs following earlier work by
the authors reported in Ref. \cite{isaac_acc_06}. As will be seen, the
approach to path generation exploits decoupling of spatial and temporal
specifications. Let $p_c(\tau) = [x(\tau), y(\tau), z(\tau)]^{\top}$ denote
a desired path to be followed by a single UAV, parameterized by $\tau \in
[0, \tau_f]$. For computational efficiency, assume each coordinate $x
(\tau), y(\tau), z(\tau)$ is represented by an algebraic polynomial of
degree $N$ of the form
\begin{eqnarray} \label{algpolynomials} x_{i}(\tau) &=& \sum_{k =
0}^{N} a_{ik} \tau^k, \qquad i = 1,2,3, \end{eqnarray} where we set $x_{1} =
x, x_{2} = y, x_{3} = z$ for notational convenience. The degree $N$ of
polynomials $x_{i}(\tau)$ is determined by the number of boundary conditions
that must be satisfied. Notice that these conditions (that involve spatial
derivatives) are computed with respect to the parameter $\tau$. There is an
obvious need to relate them to actual temporal derivatives, but this issue
will only be addressed later. Let $d_0$ and $d_f$ be the highest-order of
the spatial derivatives of $x_{i}(\tau)$ that must meet specified boundary
constraints at the initial and final points of the path, respectively. Then,
the minimum degree $N^*$ of each polynomial in (\ref{algpolynomials}) is
$N^{*} = d_0 + d_f + 1$. For example, if the desired path includes
constraints on initial and final positions, velocities, and accelerations
(second-order derivatives), then the degree of each polynomial is $N^{*} = 2
+ 2 + 1 = 5$. Explicit formulae for computing boundary conditions $p'_c(0),
p''_c(0)$ and $p'_c(\tau_f), p''_c(\tau_f)$ are given later in this section.
Additional degrees of freedom may be included by making $N > N^*$. As an
illustrative example, Table 1 shows how to compute the polynomial
coefficients in (\ref{algpolynomials}) for polynomial trajectories of
$5^{{\rm th}}$ and $6^{{\rm th}}$ degree. For $6^{{\rm th}}$ degree
polynomial trajectories,  an additional constraint on the fictitious initial
jerk (third-order derivatives) is included, which increases the order of the
resulting polynomial and affords extra (design) parameters $ x'''_{i}(0); i
= 1,2,3$.  Fig. \ref{trajsim1} shows examples of admissible $5^{{\rm th}}$
and $6^{{\rm th}}$ order polynomial paths when only $\tau_f$ or $\tau_f$ and
$x'''_{i}(0); i = 1,2,3$, viewed as optimization parameters, vary. Fig.
\ref{trajsim1} (right) shows how an increase in the number of optimization
parameters leads to a larger class of admissible paths (in this particular
case, parameters corresponding to initial jerk are added as free variables).



%The fact that the virtual arc $\tau$ was selected as a parameter in
%(\ref{algpolynomials}) allows for additional flexibility. If one
%chooses $\tau = t$, then defining spatial profiles implies defining
%speed profiles along a given path as well. This is due to the fact
%that vehicle speed along the path is related to the time derivatives
%of the trajectory coordinates as
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{velocity} v(t) &=& \sqrt{ \dot{x}_{1}^2(t)
%+ \dot{x}^2_{2}(t) + \dot{x}^2_{3}(t)}. \end{eqnarray} Figure
%\ref{speedsims1} shows the speed profiles corresponding to the
%trajectories in Figure \ref{trajsim1} for the case of $\tau = t$.
%This figure also demonstrates that increasing the number of
%optimization parameters allows one to obtain speed profiles that do
%not exceed predefined constraints.


It is important to clarify how temporal constraints may be included in the
feasible path computation process. A trivial solution would be to make
$\tau=t$. In this case, solving the polynomial fitting problem that is at
the root of Fig. \ref{trajsim1} yields the speed profiles of Fig.
\ref{speedsims1}. Little control exists over the resulting speeds even with
fifth and sixth order polynomials, because once $x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t)$
have been computed to satisfy the boundary constraints imposed, speed $v$ is
inevitably given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{velocity} v(t) &=& \sqrt{ \dot{x}_{1}^2(t) +
\dot{x}^2_{2}(t) + \dot{x}^2_{3}(t)}.
\end{eqnarray}

We therefore turn our attention to a different procedure that will afford us
the possibility of meeting strict boundary conditions and constraints
without increasing the complexity of the path generation process. To this
effect, let $v_{{\rm min}}, v_{{\rm max}}$ and $a_{{\rm max}}$ denote
predefined bounds on the vehicle's speed and acceleration, respectively. Let
$\eta(\tau) = d\tau/dt$, yet to be determined, dictate how parameter $\tau$
evolves in time. A path $p_c(\tau)$ (with an underlying assignment
$\eta(\tau)$) is said to constitute a \textit{feasible} path if the
resulting trajectory can be tracked by an UAV without exceeding
pre-specified bounds on its velocity and total acceleration along that
trajectory. With an obvious use of notation, we will later refer to a
spatial path only, without the associated $\eta(\tau)$, as a feasible path.

From (\ref{velocity}), and for a given choice of $\eta(\tau)$, the temporal
speed $v_p(\tau(t))$ and acceleration $a_p(\tau(t))$ of the vehicle along
the path (abbv. $v_p(\tau)$ and $a_p(\tau)$, respectively) are given by

\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber
v_p(\tau) \hspace{ -0.2 cm} &=& \hspace{ -0.2 cm} \eta(\tau)
\sqrt{x'^2_{1}(\tau) + x'^2_{2}(\tau) + x'^2_{3}(\tau)} ~ = ~
\eta(\tau) ||p'_c(\tau)||, \\
\label{velacc} a_p(\tau) \hspace{ -0.2 cm} &=& \hspace{ -0.2 cm}
=||\ddot{p}_c(t) || = ||p''_c(\tau) \eta^2(\tau) + p'_c(\tau) \eta'(\tau)  \eta(\tau)||.
\end{eqnarray}

In this paper we are interested in small UAVs that operate essentially at constant speeds.
Clearly, in this case speed constraints can be easily satisfied for any constant $ v_p \in [v_{{\rm min}},
v_{{\rm max}} ]$. This in turn defines

\begin{eqnarray}
\eta(\tau) &=&  \frac{v_p}{||p'_c(\tau)||} \label{defeta}\\
%\eta'(\tau)&=& -v_p \frac{(p'_c(\tau))^T p''_c(\tau)}{|| p'_c(\tau)||^3}.
\dot p_c(t) &=& v_p \frac{p'_c(\tau)}{|| p'_c(\tau)||} \label{ptau}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Now using (\ref{velacc}, \ref{defeta}) we obtain

\begin{eqnarray}
\ddot{p}_c(t)&=&\frac{v_p^2}{||p'_c(\tau)||^2} (I - \frac{p'_c(\tau)
(p'_c(\tau))^T}{||p'_c(\tau)||^2}) p''(\tau). \label{pptau}
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent Therefore, we can choose
\begin{eqnarray}
p'_c(0) &=& \frac{\dot p_c(0)}{||\dot p_c(0)||} \label{ptau0} \\
p'_c(\tau_f) &=& \frac{\dot p_c(t_f)}{||\dot p_c(t_f)||}.
\label{ptauf}
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent to satisfy boundary conditions on $\dot p_c(t)$. Similarly, setting
\begin{eqnarray*}
p''_c(0) &=& \ddot p_c(0) \label{pptau0} \\
p''_c(\tau_f) &=& \ddot p_c(t_f)  \label{pptauf}, \\
\end{eqnarray*}
satisfies equation (\ref{pptau}) at the boundaries.

On the other hand, the total acceleration $a_p$
of a vehicle flying along the path $p_c(\tau)$ at a constant speed is the product of the curvature of
the path with its velocity along the path squared. The curvature of the path $p_c(\tau)$ is given by
\[
\kappa(\tau) = \frac{1}{||p'(\tau)||}
||\frac{d}{d \tau} \frac {p'_c(\tau)}{||p'_c(\tau)||}||.
\]
\noindent Thus, using simple algebra it can be shown that
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_p(\tau) &=& v^2_p \kappa(\tau) \\
    &=&\frac{v_p^2}{||p'_c(\tau)||^2}
||(I - \frac{p'_c(\tau)(p'_c(\tau))^T}{||p'_c(\tau)||^2}) p''(\tau)||,
\end{eqnarray*}
\noindent which as expected is the norm of $\ddot p_c(t)$ (see equation (\ref{pptau}).
Therefore, for the case of constant
velocities $v_p$ a feasible path must satisfy the following set
of constraints

\begin{eqnarray} \label{cond1a}
v_{\rm min} \le v_p ~ \le v_{\rm max}, ~~~~ a_p(\tau) \le a_{\rm max},
~ \forall \tau \in [0,\tau_f].
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent for a pre-specified acceleration bound $a_{\rm max}$.

In this paper, we use the freedom afforded by a simple definition of a feasible path above to address the
problem of
time-coordinated control of multiple UAVs whereby all UAV's must arrive at their
respective final destinations at the same time.  The approach proposed here seeks to find a set of feasible
paths that makes the coordinated arrival time problem easily solvable by a team of UAVs flying at constant
speeds along these paths while coordinating their motion using the underlying communication network. In
particular, these paths should be designed in such a way as to guarantee the simultaneous arrival by all UAVs
at their respective destinations. Next, we make these ideas more precise.

Let $l_{fi}$ denote the total path length of the $ith$ path and
$v_{p_i}$ denote its velocity along this path. Then
$$
l_{fi}=\int^{\tau_{fi}}_0 ||p'_{c_i}(\tau_i)|| ~ d \tau_i.
$$
It follows immediately that the time of flight $t_{fi}$ of UAV $i$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray} \nonumber t_{fi_{{\rm min}}} &=&
\int^{\tau_{fi}}_0 \frac{||p'_{c_1}(\tau_i)||} {v_{{\rm p}_{i}}}~ d \tau_i .
\end{eqnarray}
Define a cost function $J = (\max_i t_{fi} - \min_i t_{fi})^2$. Then, making $J$ arbitrarily small over the
set of feasible paths, feasible velocities and accelerations  will
result in the desired solution to the simultaneous arrival problem
discussed above. Therefore, we propose to solve the following
path generation problem

\begin{eqnarray}
F1: \left\{
\begin{array}{llll}
\displaystyle{\min_{\tau_{fi},v_{p_i}, \; i =1,\ldots,n} \{ J  \} } \\ \\
~~ ~ subject ~
to \\ \\
~ boundary ~ conditions ~ and ~(\ref{cond1a}) ~ for~ any ~ i
\in [1,n] \\ \\
\displaystyle{\min_{j,k = 1, \ldots, n, j \ne k} ||
p_{c_j}(\tau_j) - p_{c_k}(\tau_k)||^2 \ge E^2 ~ for ~ any ~
\tau_j, \tau_k \in [0,
\tau_{fj}] \times [0, \tau_{fk}]},
\end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray}

Solution to the optimization problem $F1$ includes a set of $n$ optimal paths and constant speed profiles
that together minimize $J$ subject to an additional constraint that these paths must be spatially separated
by at least $E$ meters:
$\displaystyle{\min_{j,k = 1, \ldots, n, j \ne k} || p_{c_j}(\tau_j)
- p_{c_k}(\tau_k)||^2 \ge E^2 ~ for ~ any ~ \tau_j, \tau_k \in [0,
\tau_{fj}] \times [0, \tau_{fk}]}$
Clearly, this constraint guarantees collision avoidance.


The optimization problem $ F1$ can be effectively solved in
real-time by adding a penalty function $G$ as discussed in Ref.
\cite{Yakimenko} and by using any zero-order optimization
technique. As an example, Fig.~\ref{ex1} illustrates the
flexibility afforded by the reference polynomials to compute a
coordinated target reconnaissance mission by three UAVs. In this
case, the vector of optimization parameters is $\Xi = [\tau_{f1}
~~ \tau_{f2} ~~ \tau_{f3} ~~ v_{p_1} ~~ v_{p_2}~~ v_{p_3}]$. The
final value of the cost function $J = 1.6968e-006$ corresponds to
$|\max_i t_{fi} - \min_i t_{fi}| \le ~~ 0.0013 ~~ sec$. The value
of the optimization parameter vector $\Xi_{final} = [4010.0 ~~
4999.7 ~~ 7487.6 ~~ 15.1380 ~~ 21.2238 ~~ 29.8054]$ resulted in
spatially deconflicted paths where the minimum distance between
any two paths did not fall below $350 ~ m$ (the minimum required
distance was $100 ~ m$). The optimal speed profiles $[15.1380~m/s
~~ 21.2238~m/s ~~ 29.8054~m/s]$ are well within predefined limits
of $v_{{\rm min}}, v_{{\rm max}}$ were $15 m/sec$ and $30 m/sec$,
respectively.
%The selected speed limits were
%well inside the physical capabilities of the UAVs used in the flight
%tests.
%This was done to ensure that each path can be tracked in
%the presence of winds.
The maximum acceleration corresponding to
each path did not exceed $0.89 m/sec^2$, well below the limit of
$0.5 g$.  Finally, the resulting total path lengths for each path were
$[ \l_{f1} ~~ \l_{f2} ~~ \l_{f3} ] = [4535.4 ~~ 6358.7  ~~ 8929.7]$.
